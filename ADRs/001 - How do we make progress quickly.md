# How do we make progress quickly

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The brief does not cover everything we need to know to design the system.
Shall we ask questions to the stakeholder and fridge/kiosk providers or make assumptions?

## Decision
We will make assumptions based on the things we do know and what we can find out from provider websites.   If we ask questions we risk being blocked in the design process while waiting for responses, this would not be ideal as there is only a short amount of time (1 week) to design the system.

If this were a real project we would need significant time with the stakeholders and tech providers to fully understand the requirements and capabilities of the fridges/kiosks.

## Consequences
Some of our assumptions may be wrong, which could lead to a system design that does not fully meet the business requirements.
