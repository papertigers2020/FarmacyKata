## Context

What types of customer does the service cater for?

## Decision

Farmacy caters to the following customers:
* Subscriber - someone who has registered their details and has an active subscription to receive meals regularly. They can also purchase meals on an ad-hoc basis.
* Casual user - someone who has registered their details, uses the app/site and only purchases meals on an ad-hoc basis.
* Anonymous - people who just walk up to a POS to buy. They are also able to browse meals in their area through the app/site but its functionality is restricted (ie they cannot filter based on personal details).

## Consequences

This helps us design the scenarios/workflows that will handle the different customer types and their related data.
