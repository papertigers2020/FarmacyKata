# Will customers be able to buy/reserve a meal through the website/app?

## Status
Proposed

## Context
When a customer is looking at the local inventory of meals, can they buy/reserve a meal, thereby blocking others from purchasing it?

## Decision
A customer is not allowed to reserve a meal through the app or online because the functionality of the smart fridges means that an item being reserved would need to be removed from the fridge to guarantee it was not going to be sold to another customer.

We are also assuming that kiosk staff will also not be required to put aside items for pickup by online customers.

## Consequences
This simplifies the systems for which we need to plan.
