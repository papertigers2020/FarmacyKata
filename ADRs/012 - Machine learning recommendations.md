# Should we use Machine Learning?   

## Status  
Proposed  
 
## Context  
One of the requirements is related to recommending various meal options to the user.  The other nice to have feature could be to reduce meal wastage by smartly knowing the need of each Kitchen/PoS requirements.  

## Decision  
We would like to use machine learning to implement a recommendation engine which could recommend food items to the user.   We want to use machine learning to optimise meal making & meal delivery to the kit

## Consequences 
Since it's a startup company & cost is a constraint, machine learning implementation may require more cost.
