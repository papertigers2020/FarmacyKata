# Will we use Machine Learning to improve the business?   

## Status  
Proposed  
 
## Context  
One of the requirements is related to recommending various meal options to the user.  
The other nice to have feature could be to reduce meal wastage by smartly knowing the need of each Kitchen/PoS requirements.  

## Decision  
We will not use machine learning in this first iteration in order to reduce costs.  

However there are some clear candidate areas where it could be employed to improve the business.
Firstly the recommendation algorithm could be enhanced by employing machine learning based on customer behaviour and ratings.
Secondly we could use machine learning to predict what meals were likely to be ordered and thus reduce waste of expired meals and in the kitchen ingredients.

## Consequences 
No machine learning will be included in the architecture at this time.
