# How do we handle the expiry of meals in the fridges? 
## Status 
Proposed
 ## Context 
We need maintenance of expired items from smart fridges. 
## Decision 
The person delivering meals at smart fridges will pick expired items & then do the charity or bin it.
## Consequences
The chances of having more waste if the meals are not sold but that can be optimised using machine learning implementation mentioned in one of the other ADR.
