# How do we handle the expiry of meals in the fridges? 
## Status 
Proposed
 ## Context 
It is important NFR that the business is safe for customers to use. It would not reflect well on the company if a customer bought a meal that was out of date.  A meal that is expired should not be able to be purchased. 

## Decision 
The distributor that delivers meals to points of sale will remove expired items.  There is an opportunity here for the distributor to donate the expired meals to charity.

## Consequences
Our system does not need to handle the expiry dates of meals, this will be handled entirely by the distributor.'
There is a machine learning opportunity here to reduce wastage (see ADR012)
