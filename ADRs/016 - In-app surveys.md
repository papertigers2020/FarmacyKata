# How will we enable in-app surveys?

## Status
Accepted

## Context
A requirement is to provide the capability to serve in-app surveys to customers using the mobile app.  Surveys will need to be created by an admin user and data will need to be collected for analysis.

## Decision
There are many 3rd party providers of this kind of functionality.  One of these providers will be chosen to integrate with.  It is expected that Admins will use an external UI to create surveys and get the results.

## Consequences
A review of all 3rd party providers will need to be done and the best selected.

There will be a cost associated with using any 3rd party service.

There will be additional work to be done in the app development to integrate with the 3rd party provider.
