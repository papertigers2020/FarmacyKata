# How do we handle payments from customers?

## Status
Superceded by ADR008

## Context
We need to take payment for meals and subscriptions

## Decision
Customers will pay at either the smart fridge or kiosk when picking up meals.  
Payments through the website for subsctiptions will be handled by the provider of the pre-paid cards.

## Consequences
There is no need to take payment within our own system, 3rd parties deal with all the transactions.
