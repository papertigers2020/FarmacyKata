# How will we build the Web and Mobile apps?

## Status
Accepted

## Context
There is a requirement to support users on Web and Mobile devices.

## Decision
We would build a single Progressive Webapp to service users on the web and on mobile devices.

## Consequences
It means we only need to build a single App for the web and mobile UIs.

It should be cheaper than building a native app as well as a website.

There should be SEO benefits.

We do not have to built both an iOS and Android version of the app.

We do not have to rely on Apple and Google Playstores.
